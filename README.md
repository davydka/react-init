#Project Boilerplate
A simple starter repo for new projects. Uses a variety of tools including:

* React
* Webpack
* NPM

##Getting Started
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/davydka/react-init`
* Enter your repo's directory: `cd react-init`

```
npm install
npm run watch
pm2 start http-server --name="app" -- -p 1981 -c-1 -s
pm2 start browser-sync --name="app-sync" --interpreter="none" -- start --files '<APP-DIR>build/bundle.js' --proxy localhost:1981 --reload-delay 100 --no-ui --port 1881 --no-notify --no-open
```
##Building as a new Repo
First steps are to checkout the boilerplate and link it to your own git repo.

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/davydka/react-init.git folder-name`
* Enter your repo's directory: `cd folder-name`
* Remove this init from the git remote: `git remote rm origin`
* If needed, create your new github repo from the command line: `curl -u 'USER' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"REPO"}'`
	* replace USER with your username and REPO with your repository/application name
* Add your remote: `git remote add origin https://github.com:USER/REPO.git`
	* again, replace USER with your username and REPO with your repository/application name
* Push to your new remote repo: `git push origin master`

You've now checked out the boilerplate and linked it to your own repo. You can now begin local development.
